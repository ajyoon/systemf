The current cell is 10

This is where the program main loop should begin

At the end of the program the memory should be restored to *exactly* the way
  it is at this point in execution and the program should loop infinitely back
  to this point

Request Header Parsing ========================================================

  To parse the request header we make several limitations and assumptions
  We assume all requests are well formed GET requests
  We assume the address component of the request is less than 28 characters long
  We assume the address contains no whitespace
  We treat the address as a file path relative to the current working directory

  To extract the address component we can assume that the address occupies the space
  between the sixth character (after the leading slash after "GET ") and the following
  whitespace character; For example in "GET /index(dot)html HTTP/1(dot)1\n"
  these restrictions will extract "index(dot)html"

  To perform this address extraction we inject a null terminator (0) at the
  first whitespace (32) after the leading address slash

  Move to cell 69 (start of address after leading slash)
  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

  Change the first cell from 69 that is a whitespace (ascii 32)
  to 0 (a null terminator for the file path string)

  Make value in cell 27 ahead nonzero to kick off loop
  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
  +
  [
    Null current cell
    [-]
    Move back to the cell in the buffer being looked at
    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
    Copy current value 27 characters ahead
    [->>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>+>+<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<]
    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    [-<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<+>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>]
    Place comparison value in cell right ahead of copy
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    Set comparison_cell = (comparison_cell == cell_to_the_right)
    [-<->]+<[>-<[-]]>
    If the character was a whitespace the current cell == 1; else 0
    Invert result so that the loop breaks as soon as a whitespace is encountered
    -
  ]
  Once the first whitespace is encountered jump back to corresponding
  position in read buffer and zero that location
  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  [-]

  The file pathname being requested is now stored in cells 69 to wherever
  the null terminator has been placed

  We can now move back to a known cell by moving back to cell 64
  <[<]>

  We are now ready to open the file


open() ========================================================================


  Current cell is 64
  Pathname argument content begins in cell 69

  We need to zero out cells 64 to 68 and everything after the pathname

  [-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>  Zero out cells 64 to 68

  Current cell is 69

  >   Move into pathname
  [>] Move to null terminator
  zero at most 27 cells to the right

  [-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>[-]>

  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

  [<]>  Move back to cell 69

  Next we need to know how many cells long the pathname is and we need to
  store it in cell 68

  We can do this by copying the entire pathname cells 128 and onward
  and destructively counting it from the end; placing the final count
  in cell 126:
  [
    Duplicate value first to i plus 27 and i plus 59
    [-

    Return to place in original buffer

    Move forward
